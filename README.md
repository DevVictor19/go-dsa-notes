## Big O Notation

Big O Notation is a powerful tool used in computer science to describe the time and complexity or space complexity of algorithms.

Big-O is a way to express the upper bound of an algorithm’s time or space complexity.

### Importance of Big O Notation

1. It provides a way to compare the performance of different algorithms and data structures, and to predict how they will behave as the input size increases.

2. It provides a way to describe how the runtime or space requirements of an algorithm grow as the input size increases.

3. Allows programmers to compare different algorithms and choose the most efficient one for a specific problem.

### A Quick Way to find Big O of an Expression

- Ignore the lower order terms and consider only highest order term.
- Ignore the constant associated with the highest order term.

### Common Big-O Notations

1. Linear O(n)
2. Logarithmic O(log n)
3. Quadratic O(n²)
4. Cubic O(n³)
5. Polynomial O(n^k)
6. Exponential O(2^n)
7. Factorial O(n!)
